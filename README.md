# gans_data_pipeline

written by Philip Gro√ü, Feb 2024

This repository contains files for creating a local and cloud-based data pipeline that retrieves city, weather and flight data which is fed to a custom database. For details, please refer to the accompanying article: [https://medium.com/@silandkyanite](https://medium.com/@silandkyanite

The file utils.py contains a collection of custom functions, which are called in the IPython-Notebooks in order to create the actual pipeline. 

The JSON-config files must be updated with your own API and database login information.
